## Instructions

1. Download this package as a .zip (this can be done through the green 'Clone or Download' button at the top right)
2. Visit the [Gurobi](www.gurobi.com) website, set up an account and download a free installation of the Gurobi Optimizer.
  + You will need to download a license in order for the software to run Gurobi. Free academic licenses are available for use by faculty members, students, or members of the research or administrative staffs of degree-granting academic institutions.
  + When installing your license, save the license file in the default location. If the optimization does not work, it may be that the license file cannot be found by the software. If this is the case, set the environment variable 'GRB_LICENSE_FILE' to point to the exact location of the license file. 
3. Navigate to the 'x64/Release/' folder.
4. Run KPDGUI.exe
